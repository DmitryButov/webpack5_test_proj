Getting started
--------------------
NodeJs is using for building web-project with webpack

for start under docker (as usual user, and use "ports" part for expose)
docker-compose run --rm --service-ports -u 1000 nodejs-dev




    # project creation with webpack usage
    npm init                             - create new nodejs package - in root folder of furure packege (app/)
    npm install -D webpack webpack-cli   - need install webpack as dev-dependencies

    # install some webpack pligins for development
    npm i -D html-webpack-plugin
    npm install copy-webpack-plugin --save-dev   - for copy static-files into output folder without any modifications

    # install some loaders
    npm i -D style-loader css-loader             - for —Åss

    # for remove something (from dev dependencies of package) - use uninstall, for example
    npm uninstall --save-dev clean-webpack-plugin

    # next step - add some scripts in package.json (as dev, build, start, watch) - see in code:
    "scripts": {
        ....
    }

    # usage
    npm install .      - install all again (you can remove node_modules folder before)

    # usage scripts
    npm run dev        - use webpack in development mode
    npm run build      - use webpack in production mode (minify files, etc.)
    npm run watch      - watch and rebuild on changes, development mode


Babel support
--------------
see instruction on  https://babeljs.io/setup, select webpack

npm install --save-dev babel-loader @babel/core
npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-env
